# The Investigation

The administration was quick to respond, launching a full-scale investigation into the matter. Professors were asked to review all of their students' assignments and exams, looking for any signs of cheating or plagiarism. The process was time-consuming and laborious, but necessary to restore the integrity of the school's academic programs.

As the investigation continued, more students were implicated in the scandal. It was discovered that a small group of students had been operating a cheating ring, selling answers to exams and papers to their classmates for a hefty price. The ringleaders were quickly expelled from the school, with the others facing disciplinary action ranging from probation to suspension.
